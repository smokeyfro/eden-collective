  is a signatory to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article

  and supports public health. Because of its essential nature, agriculture and food
  keeps going when other industries fail. For every farmer there are many related
  jobs in processing, distribution, sales, and food preparation. \n\n4. Our food system
  is unduly dependent on distant suppliers. Most of us rely on a system that rarely
  has more than 3-4 days of fresh food stockpiled locally—food that travels hundreds
  or thousands of kilometers. Excessive transportation (such as milk trucked out of
  province for processing and back again for sale) is dictated by economies of scale
  that do not account for environmental costs or loss of product freshness. This practice
  is vulnerable to interruptions of various kinds and is poor risk management. \n\n5.
  What we see in the grocery store is a vulnerable perfection. The bounty on the grocery
  store shelves gives the impression that our food systems are in fine shape. The
  perfection—in looks and variety—comes with a price, but all the risks and most of
  the long-term environmental and social costs are hidden. For instance, you can buy
  fruits and vegetables all year round which have to be imported outside our growing
  season—these products are grown far away, under rules over which we have no control,
  by people who may be forfeiting their own food security to grow cash crops for our
  markets. \n\n6. We can only control what is close to home. The way food products
  are grown/raised, prepared, processed and packaged can only be effectively monitored
  in our own jurisdiction where people have some say about the rules. \n\n7. The jurisdiction
  that cannot feed its people is at the mercy of whoever can. Ultimately a community,
  province or nation is beholden to its food suppliers. The use of food as a weapon
  is becoming more common around the world. It is folly to let go of our capability
  of feeding ourselves. \n\n8. It is vital to preserve the blueprint (capacity, skills
  and tools to feed ourselves). In less than a century we have gone from societies
  where almost everyone was on the land to societies  where hardly anybody is left
  to train new growers in regenerative farming techniques. We are losing the people
  who could teach us the arts of growing, harvesting, preserving and cooking our own
  food, and many of us are losing the skills. \n\n9. People are rightly concerned
  about food-health connections. Consumers are growing increasingly concerned about
  the safety of their food. This relates to manufactured food products and questions
  about additives, pesticide residues, hormones, or genetically modified organisms;
  and to links between diet and disease (such as cancer or Mad Cow Disease). \n\n10.
  Good food is the basis of health. Nutrition is tied to health. The major causes
  of death and disability in our society (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer)
  can all be significantly affected by healthy eating choices and lifestyles. \n\n11.
  People in our community are hungry and/or undernourished. Since the start of Covid
  19 when soup kitchens and aid for the poor were locally available in most underprivileged
  areas.  Today, most of these programs and aid agencies have closed or scaled down.
  Leaving behind a community with high rates of unemployment and in turn, many hungry
  families and children.\n\n12. Inability to pay should not mean hunger. Healthy,
  affordable food should be available to everyone needing it.\n\n13. What we eat should
  not exploit those who produced it. In a global food system dedicated to free trade
  that encourages exports, the trend is to grow monoculture crops on a large scale
  for distant markets. All countries end up doing this at the expense of the land,
  the water, their farmers and their workers, families and communities. \n\n14. Cheap
  food is too good to be true. Our reluctance to spend more, coupled with international
  trade pressures and corporate concentration, make it difficult for our farmers to
  stay in business. If the environmental and social costs were taken into account
  (fuels for transportation, loss of species diversity, loss of jobs, loss of community)
  the equation would be far different and cheap would be exposed as not cheap at all.
  There is also an issue about food value. It is normally taken to mean cost. We need
  to define what values we most want in our food and what trade-offs we are willing
  to make. Value added, for instance, could mean fresher or more flavourful rather
  than further processed. (Further processing often decreases nutritional value.)\n\nAdaped

Fourteen Reasons Why Food Security is Important 

Food security is important because:

1\. Everybody has to eat. The obvious should not go without saying. Our dependency on food is so central that we often do not consider it or who is benefitting and who is paying.

2\. Food is a basic human right. South Africa is a signatory to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 25 includes the “right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care … “ Human rights leaders around the world are concerned about actions of global institutions like the World Trade Organization that violate these and other human rights.
