  Eden Hub is still quite a new initiative and we are actively recruiting members of the community to get involved. We'll update this page as new members come on board.

  Avid home-steader, mum of three, wife to one, ninja fermenter / brewer and gardener, Becky brings a wealth of experience and an let-get-stuff done attitude.

  Chris Rault

  Also an avid gardener, recent  distiller, web ninja and entrepreneur, Chris is responsible for all the technical aspects of the project, while also facilitating community events from his farm in Dieprivier.
