An informal get together to share/swap and sell seeds, seedlings and plants right here in Hoekwil.

All are welcome.  If you have seeds or plants to share or swap (not selling) come and set up a table free of charge.

Stalls are available for anyone interested in selling items such as seeds, seedlings, plants and gardening accessories.  For this special "lets get ready for spring" market we will also have stalls offering locally made goods and handmade items. Stalls cost R50 each.

See you all there!

To book a stall please contact:
